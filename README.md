An Open Source Taxi/Ride Sharing Application Project

Nowadays almost everyone is one or another ride/taxi sharing application from mobile. Just out of curiosity to explore the challenges these companies might have solved during creating these applications, we have started this project.

# Current problems
1) limited players in this market but market is huge.
2) Technology development and management requires expertize and investment
3) Due to monopoly, existing services are taking customers on the ride, by charging unfair fares in time of need.


This application should be useful for people who wants to start a taxi sharing business and generate employment and also give people more options to ride. 


# Goal
1. Application should help in building a profitable business.
2. Drivers should be earning more and customers has to pay less.
